    <h1>Egg-Cake</h1>
    <p>An egg cake is a simple, fluffy cake made primarily with eggs, sugar, flour, and sometimes butter or milk. It's known for its light texture and mild sweetness. The eggs are usually beaten until airy, which helps the cake rise without needing much baking powder.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs - 3 to 4 (the main ingredient for fluffiness)
</li>
<br>
    
<li>Sugar - about ½ cup (adjust to taste)
</li><br>
        <li>	All-purpose flour - 1 cup
</li><br>
        <li>Baking powder - 1 teaspoon (optional, for extra rise)</li><br>
        <li>Butter or oil - 2 to 3 tablespoons (for moisture)</li><br>
        <li>Milk - ¼ cup (optional, for softness)</li><br>
        <li>Vanilla essence - ½ teaspoon (for flavor)
</li><br>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the oven
Preheat to 180°C (350°F). Grease and line a cake tin.</li>
<br>
        <li>Beat the eggs and sugar
In a large bowl, whisk eggs and sugar until pale, thick, and fluffy. This step is key for the cake’s airy texture.</li>
<br>    
<li>Add wet ingredients
Mix in melted butter (or oil), milk, and vanilla essence. Stir gently.</li>
<br>    
<li>Sift and fold dry ingredients
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together. Gradually fold into the egg mixture using a spatula—avoid overmixing to keep the batter light.</li>
<br>    
<li>Pour and bake
Transfer the batter into the prepared tin. Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
<br>    
<li>Cool and serve
Let the cake cool before slicing. Enjoy plain, or dust with powdered sugar for a simple finish.
